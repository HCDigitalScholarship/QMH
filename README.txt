The backend of this site uses the Django framework (documentation can be found at https://www.djangoproject.com/).

The frontend of this site uses Foundation5 (the complete download). The documentation for Foundation can be found at http://foundation.zurb.com/develop/download.html.

We may use a template for the rest of the frontend, but that is yet to be determined.

The visualizations on this site were made using the following libraries:
-JQuery (http://jquery.com/)
-D3 (http://d3js.org/)
-CartoDB
-Mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com/)
-Arc.js (https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/arcjs/)

All of the python functions needed to create each of the visualizations are in the views_viz.py, while the functions needed to show the generalpages are in the views.py file.

This project uses the following python libraries:
-django
-json
