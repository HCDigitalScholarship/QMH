	<h2> Work Therapy </h2>
          <p>Occupational therapy was an important part of all asylums run on moral treatment, but it was especially crucial at the Asylum. Bonsall needed the patients to work on the farm and in the kitchen because the Asylum could not afford to hire enough help to run it without patient labor. Quite apart from the benefits to the Asylum, work was supposed to help the patients recover. An Asylum pamphlet argued that insanity was often “nourished by want of suitable occupation” (<a href = "#" data-reveal-id="mModal">Waln 27</a>), and Bonsall wrote in his Day Book that work acted as a “stimulant” which helped patients engage with the world again (<a href = "#" data-reveal-id = "aModal">Seventh Month, 23, 1817</a>). Historian Patricia D’Antonio argued that the work made the patients feel like they were a part of the Asylum family, and gave them adult responsibilities, despite their subordinate role as patients (<a href = "#" data-reveal-id = "bModal">127</a>). The male patients helped Bonsall and the gardener run the Asylum’s farm. They planted, plowed, cut wood, and hauled water, among other things. These jobs also gave the men exercise and access to fresh air. While the men were helping on the farm, female patients sewed, knitted, did laundry, and cooked. Their jobs were equally important in running the Asylum, but gave them much less access to exercise and fresh air. </p>

	<h2> Recreational Therapy </h2>
          <p> The Asylum also used play as therapy. However, its early forays into recreational therapy were modest. The fact that the Asylum used recreational therapy as a part of moral treatment is peculiar, given that Quakers, especially <a href = "/glossary#Orthodox Quakers">Orthodox</a> ones, believed that most games were distractions from living a useful and holy life. Time spent playing was time that could not be spent thinking about God or doing good works. The Friends Asylum’s relative slowness to adopt recreational therapy may be explained by the tension between moral treatment and the Quaker view of games. Bonsall did record instances of the Asylum’s use of recreational therapy in the early years. For example, the Asylum had a ball court in which the men played games like Nine Men’s Morris, and the <a href = "glossary#Visting Manager"> Visiting Managers</a> bought the patients a velocipede, or type of early bicycle, in June of 1819. The Managers’ promptitude in obtaining a velocipede is impressive, given that the velocipede had only been introduced to Philadelphia that spring (<a href="#" data-reveal-id = "cModal">Herlihy 39-40</a>). However, the Asylum’s ball court and velocipede pale in comparison to the multitude of recreational activities available at other early asylums.</p>

	<h2> Occupational Therapy at Other Asylums </h2>	
          <p>Other early American asylums also thought that giving the patients an occupation was necessary. However, they occupied their patients with games and leisure activities instead of productive work. For example, the Pennsylvania Hospital provided lectures, magic lantern slideshows, and plays for their patients almost every night. The Pennsylvania Hospital's occupational therapy system depended on the social class of the patient. Poorer patients were given the chance to work in the kitchens or garden for reduced board, while richer patients were encouraged to read, do fancy work, and cultivate hobbies. Since only some patients were expected to work, the Pennsylvania Hospital did not encourage patients to see their work as essential to the hospital's existence. This system of social stratification was very different from the atmosphere at the Friends Asylum, where, an 1825 history explained, “Females, delicately reared, accustomed at home to little manual labor, may be found, willingly and cheerfully, assisting in the kitchen, or in the chambers” as a part of their treatment (<a href = "#" data-reveal-id = "mModal">Waln 29</a>). Under the Friends Asylum model, patients worked alongside their superintendent and keepers to keep the Asylum running smoothly, just like in a family. The Friends Asylum did start moving towards occupying their patients primarily with leisure activities in the mid-1830s, but it caused a shift away from the early conception of the Asylum as a family. </p>
