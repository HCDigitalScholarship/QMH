      <p> Do problems of gender arise when studying Friends Asylum?  Is there more to say about how male patients were encouraged to play as part of their treatment while female patients were only encouraged to do chores? </p>
	<p>How was female hysteria perceived in Friends Asylum? Did Quakers have a different or similar notion of hysteria in comparison with other mental institutions of its time? </p>

	<p> What more can be learned from the Orthodox-Hicksite split and Friends Asylum? How did the split affect the Asylum, its governance, and principles?</p>
	<p>Is there more to be said about how the Asylum had such a large focus on recreation and play for its patients? How did this fit with the founders' Quakerism?  </p>

      <p>Think about looking at Friends Asylum, its role, and changes in their mission during these periods of history: the Civil War, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, etc.  How did the way mental health ws viewed change during these significant historical periods? How were those changes enacted or not at Friends Hospital?   </p>

     <p>Looking at the Asylum during a certain historical period of time, or comparing the Asylum at different times, what type(s) of patients were found at the Asylum? What disorders were common? What disorders were cured?  Track data of patients entering and exiting the hospital, their average stay, etc.  Use annual reports and other primary sources to create tables and show trends. </p>
	<p>There are many examples of patients being admitted into the Asylum because of masturbation.  How did Quakers view masturbation in relation to insanity and treat it? </p>
	<p> How do the superintendent's diaries from the early years talk about patient maladies?  What vocabulary is used?  When are patients referred to as family members and when are they not? </p>

      <p> There's rumor that the Asylum and its many underground tunnels may have played a part in the Underground Railroad.  What more can we learn about this obscured past?  How else may Friends Hopsital have served as an "Asylum" in the traditional and original sense of the word?</p>

     <p>With the material we have on the case of Morgan Hinchman suing the Asylum, do an in-depth study of him, his case, and its significance.  </p>
     <p>Take another patient you see to have an interesting and compelling story, and find out more about them, their past, and their stay at Friends Asylum.  For instance, while she was researching the founding of Friends of Asylum, Abigail Corcoran found patients Ruth S., Benjamin C., Nathan Y., Mary R., Samuel S., and Abraham S. to have interesting and notable histories (read more on the <a href = "/profiles"> Patient Profiles Page </a>)</p>
